# Day one
Just going to copy paste from our inital brainstorming doc here:
-Puzzles(?)
	-Puzzles in between levels - Mario Party style
	-Let go of puzzles and focus on the platforming
	-Other palette cleansers between levels

-Everyone on one level vs everyone gets their own game room


-Theme Ideas
	- Monkeys/Rainforest
	- Kids climbing treehouses/clouds/go into space
	- Boat going up a river

-Powerups from the challenges
	-double jumps,
-grap hooks,
-wall jump
-speed boost
-.5 gravity

thats a fun aesthetic
we can start in a kids backyard
and like
build up a treehouse
or jack and bean stalk
you’re a kid and you’re just playing in your backyard imagining things
like your mom calls you in for dinner
and “game over” would be
like your mom calls you in for dinner
yeah

-Core Values
	-Wondrous
	-Family fun
	-Imagination
	-Verticality
	-Crisp platforming

-Growth
	-Changes somehow compound through the levels

-Scoring
	-Direct points based on placement
	-Points based on how fast you finish
	-Bonus stage
	-Win if you’re behind and get extra points

Ultimate Chicken Horse
Mario Party

Overall, we decided to make a multiplayer platformer racer with an aesthetic and theme that focuses on childhood wonder. We are still deciding exactly how to break up the monotony of x platforming challenges in a row.

# Core Values and Mechanic
Core Values:
Wonder, Verticality, Precise Platforming, Family Fun, Fast-Paced, Cute, Imaginative

Core Mechanic:
Our "Toy", or core mechanic, is the ability to race your fellow players up a fun, dynamic platforming level with precise controls and the risk of falling and losing progress(or, conversely, taking the lead after seeing your opponent fall a great distance) at any moment. 

# 11/11 Update
As of Novemeber 11th, we've got a complete prototype for the platforming and movement systems, so we are going to be refining those toys over the coming weeks. We also have several basic animations for the player. By next Monday, we will have the movment and platforming finished, a prototype of multiplayer, and a tilemap with handmade visuals. Daniel has also spent some type paper protyping puzzles and minigames which he will implement in the coming weeks.
For the UI, we've considered adding powerups as cosmetics directly on the player model. We haven't discussed UI much in depth yet, because there isn't very much information we need to convery to the player over the in-game interface.
